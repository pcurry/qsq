Queueing Statistics - Quickly!

Basically, I wanted more information from the queues in AWS SQS than was easily provided by the API. So I wrote a little API to wrap theirs, and provide some more pleasant and useful data. Then that contract ran out, and I left the code there.

Now I think I should be implementing something simple but non-trivial to keep my coding chops, and this is the thing I'm most interested in tackling at the moment.
